I've added a few background pictures in the homepage I obtained from a website called <a href='https://www.pexels.com/'>Pixels<\/a> and the pictures appealed to me because I tend to like night time themes so that came across in my website also I'm slightly camera shy but they may be replaced with pictures I've taken at some point. I used <strong>AngularJS<\/strong> to build this website as it was a framework I've been wanting to use for a while. I learned how to use AngularJS from a website called <a href='https://www.codecademy.com'>Codecademy</a> which I've used to complete many of the courses they have(Some have been removed at this point) of languages and other useful skills such as Ruby, Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, Sass, HTML, ReactJS, AngularJS and Ruby on Rails. <br /><br />The blog part of the site will include posts of updates, projects that I will be working on, events that I will go to or have been to and other arbitary stuff. To conclude this short first blog about my website, at the moment it is lacking some content but that will no longer be the case overtime. I appreciate you taking the time to visit my website and look forward to the future."
