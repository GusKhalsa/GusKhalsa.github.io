I've added a few pictures in the homepage I obtained from a website called pixels and it appealed to me because I tend to like the night time type themes so that correlated across to my website. The blog part of the site will include posts of updates, projects that I will be working on, events that I will go to or have been to and other arbitary stuff. To conclude this short first blog about my website, at the moment it is lacking some content but that will no longer be the case overtime. I appreciate you taking the time to visit my website and look forward to the future."
